# House Price Predictor Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices. The model is trained on a dataset of historical house prices and various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can find a sample dataset for testing purposes in the `data` folder. The dataset contains the following columns:

- `price`: The target variable representing the house price (in dollars).
- `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- `bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- `sq_ft`: The square footage of the house.
- `location`: The location of the house.
